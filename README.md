# How I resolved the Potential Loss of Keychain Access Warning

I received an email from the Apple Connect indicating the [Technical Q&A QA1726](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1726/_index.html) warning. I transfered the application to a new account and, after that, I submitted a new version to Testflight.

The workaround was taken from this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64164363)ðŸŽ‰. However, it was just the solution description and it was on me to provided a concret implementation.

I'm really hoping to help somebody out there.
